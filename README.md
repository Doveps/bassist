# Bassist
The bassist reads output produced by the `scanner` and calculates the
baseline for a host, plus modifications made to that host.

# Usage
Find out where your scanner put its output (for example:
`~/scanner/local`). Then pass that directory to the bassist:
`./bassist.py -s ~/scanner/local`

# Python 3
Bassist requires Python 3!

## OS X
```sh
brew install python3
```
